        <p>Locked up behind these walls<br>
        Ages of trying to cope<br>
        Behind december's walls<br>
            
        Years and years of finding myself<br>
        This was the longest journey I’ve ever made<br>
        Days of wasting tears and no one cares<br>
        Countless nights, drowning in worthless nightmares<br>
        Ages of trying to cope<br>
        Ages of not giving up hope<br>
        
        Keeping alive the hope for a deeper sense,<br>
        For a better understanding of my world,<br>
        My destiny, my goals and myself<br>
        Climbing out of that endless misery, no security, no confirmation of an end<br>
        Alone in the masses<br>
        
        Is there anybody on my side? please appear now<br>
        I feel myself slowly crumbling<br>
        And when the rain is coming I can feel myself melting into the ground<br>
        Becoming the puppet I never meant to be<br>
        
        I don't know how, I don’t know why, so sure I don't deserve this<br>
        But there came an eastern wind that brought me forward, pushed me out of the sludge<br>
        Formed my actual self, buried my inner demons<br>
        Locked up behind december's walls<br>
        
        The rain can't force me down anymore<br>
        I’m strong enough to hold back the storms now<br>
        Seeing my visions clear like never before<br>
        From that day I met you<br>
        
        For what you are, for what you saw in me<br>
        Now I can see clearly all the wrong pathes I took<br>
        The prospect is perfect<br>
        From the roof I see down the walls<br>
        I am bulletproof<br>
        
        And if the vultures are ever circling above me again<br>
        You can be sure I won’t let you go because I know you can still feel my passion<br>
        Strengthened by the scars I’ve collected in the past<br>
        I will move heaven and earth to save this<br>
        Because I’m bulletproof</p>
